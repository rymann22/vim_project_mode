Making vim look more similar to vscode 

I wanted to make vim look more similar to the layout of VSCode or other editors like that. I didn't need the full functionality, more so in the sense of having the file explorer on the left, main editing window on the right, and a terminal at the bottom.


This is still a work in progress!
