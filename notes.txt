When your cursor is in the top "edit" window, you can resize it by doing the following
increase by 10 lines
- 10 <ctrl+w>+

decrease by 5 lines
- 5 <ctrl+w>-

set the height
- 50 <ctrl+w>_

Move around 
<ctrl+w> h  - move to the window on the left
<ctrl+w> l  - move to the window on the right
<ctrl+w> j  - move to the window on the below
<ctrl+w> k  - move to the window on the above
note: while in "command mode" in vim, you can also use hljk to move around
